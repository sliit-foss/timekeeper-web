## What is Timekeeper ?

Timekeeper is an automated tracing solution which injects logging statements into your code at build time.

The full process revolves around using a plugin for an existing build tool to detect your function invokations and decorating them with a specially crafted function
which handles the logging. The generated logs include:

- The function name
- Time taken to execute the function
- Timestamp (in ISO 8601 format)
- Correlation ID (if configured as described <Link to="/docs/configuration#context-setup"><b>here</b></Link>)

The correlation ID is a unique identifier which is passed through the function call chain. This allows you to trace the execution of a request through multiple
functions and services.

The entirety of this means that you can **get a detailed view of your code execution without having to change it**.
